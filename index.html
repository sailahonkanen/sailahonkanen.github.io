              <br>
              <p>In my professional field, you must usually work as part of a team. So, I want to be able to clearly communicate my ideas and negotiate with my team members. I want to be a reliable team member so that colleges can trust me. I want to be able to give constructive feedback to my team members. One of my personal goal is that I will find myself placement where I can do my internship by the end of the year. Those skills are useful even for job search process.</p>

              <br>
              <p>Self-awareness is important not just in my professional field. It’s important in every professional field. When you have a better understanding of yourself, you can experience yourself as unique and separate individual. I want to know my own strengths as well as areas where I would like to make improvements. I want to give better feedback to myself and receive feedback from others. I think that in my professional field is important to be honest with yourself and colleges about your professional skills.  It’s important to have courage to say if you don’t understand something and ask for help.</p>

              <br>
              <p>Get to know more about product development and the role of product manager needs several skills and those skills are useful also in my professional field. I want to show more my professional skills what I already have and use them during demo creation. In my professional field agile methods are important so I want to learn to use them in product development. I think that agile methods can also help me to deal better with time management and stress.</p>

                <h3 class="mb-0">Communication / teamwork skills</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I didn’t reach my goal to find myself placement where I can do my internship, but I know now what to do with it and I have more tools and skills which I can use to reach that goal. I also have clear plans for the next year. 
                    In my previous studies I worked normally individually so there was a big difference coming to DevLab and start working in interdisciplinary teams. That experience taught me that I can be valuable team member. I got feedback from my team members that I’m good team player. I can work hard and take responsibilities for the team. I improved my communication skills and now I’m more confident about myself and I can share my ideas and my opinions with others.

                  <br>
                  <p>After DevLab I’m now confident about my skills. I understand better my strengths and weaknesses. 	It was so helpful to me that during the last half of semester we had team coaching meetings every second week. First it felt little bit scary and awkward but now I understand how much it changed myself and my team. That feedback what I received and also what I gave to others helped me to improve my self-knowledge and self-awareness.</p>

                    <p>When I started working on my team the prototype was just made with bike lamp and now it has 3D-printed case, Arduino inside and included led light and motion sensor. Now I know that every time you can learn something new about your solution while testing and from feedback.</p>
